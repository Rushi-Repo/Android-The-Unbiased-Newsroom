# The Unbiased Newsroom
## Version - Android. (IOS coming soon)

What spin do you want on your News?

The slider lets you choose your news diet the way you aim to choose your food: deliberately rather than impulsively. The slider lets you choose the political stance of your news sources. It classifies media outlets based on how close they are to power. The model analyzes the news sources that normally accept or challenge claims by powerful entities such as the government and large corporations. Rather than leaving them alone, youâ€™ll probably enjoy spicing things up by occasionally sliding toward them to see what those you disagree with are writing.
